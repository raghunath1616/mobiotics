# Coding Practices

1. Import all then libraries at top. If using React, make that first import.
2. Try not to use bind, use arrow function instead when you want change context.
3. DO NOT create directory for one component. Only create directories when component is becoming complex and need refactoring.

Example
(Don't Do this) `UIComponents/Button/Button.js`
Instead do,`UIComponents/Button.js`

4. Use of spread operator
Example
Don't
